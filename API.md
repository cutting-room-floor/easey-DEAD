# Easing

Easing is moving from one point or zoom to another in a fluid motion, instead of just 'popping' from
place to place. It's useful for map-based storytelling, since users get a better idea of geographical
distance.

## var ease = mapbox.ease()

**Returns** an easey object, which has the following methods:

### ease.from(coord)

**Arguments:**

Set the starting coordinate for the easing. You don't usually need to call this, because easings default to the current coordinate.

* `coord` is an instance of `MM.Coordinate` representing the starting coordinate for the easing.

**Returns** the easey object.

### ease.to(coord)

Set the destination coordinate for the easing. 

**Arguments:**

* `coord` is an instance of `MM.Coordinate` representing the destination coordinate for the easing. 

Since easey deals exclusively in Coordinates, [the reference for converting between points, locations, and coordinates in Modest Maps is essential reading](https://github.com/stamen/modestmaps-js/wiki/Point,-Location,-and-Coordinate).

**Returns** the easey object.

### ease.zoom(level)

Set the zoom level of the `to` coordinate that easey is easing to.

**Arguments:**

* `level` is a number representing the zoom level

**Returns** the easey object.


### ease.t(value)

Sets the map to a specific point in the easing.

**Arguments:**

* `value` is a float between 0 and 1, where 0 is `from` and 1 is `to`.

**Returns** the easey object.

### ease.future(parts)

Get the future of an easing transition, given a number of parts for it to be divided over. This is a convenience function for calling `easey.t()` a bunch of times.

**Arguments:**

* `parts` is an positive integer representing the number of parts to divide the easing into.

**Returns** an array of `MM.Coordinate` objects representing each in-between location.


### ease.easing(name)

Set the easing curve. 

**Arguments:**

* `name` is the string name of the easing to use. Current options are:
    * 'easeIn'
    * 'easeOut'
    * 'easeInOut'
    * 'linear'

**Returns** the easey object.

### ease.path(pathname)

Set the type of path - the type of interpolation between points.

**Arguments:**

* `pathname` is a string name of the path to use. Current options are:
    * `screen`: a 'straight line' path from place to place - in the Mercator projection, this is a rhumb line
    * `about`: the default path for a double-click zoom: this keeps a single coordinate in the same screen pixel over the zoom transition

**Returns** the easey object.

### ease.run([time [, callback])

Start an _animated ease_. Both parameters are optional.

**Arguments:**

* `time` is an integer representing the duration of the easing in milliseconds (default is 1000).
* `callback` is a Javascript function that is called when the map has reached its destination.

**Returns** the easey object.

### var isRunning = ease.running()

**Returns** `true` or `false` depending on whether easey is currently animating the map.

### ease.stop()

Abort the currently running animation.

**Returns** the easey object.
